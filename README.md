# Genspark Execution Bridge

Proof-first, executor-neutral control foundation for integrating safe task orchestration with MCP/API executors without assuming an undocumented Genspark remote execution API.

## Phase 1 scope

Phase 1 implements this runnable path:

`Control Plane → Task Model → Policy → Executor Interface → Mock Executor → MCP Safe Tools → Verification → Audit`

Included:

- Strict canonical task schema: `task_id`, `type`, `input`, `requested_capabilities`, `risk_level`, `created_at`, and `metadata`.
- State machine: `created → validated → authorized → queued → running → succeeded | failed | cancelled`.
- Independent, fail-closed policy checks with structured denial reasons.
- Executor-neutral contract and deterministic `MockExecutor` success, failure, retry, timeout, and error behavior.
- Capability-gated `GensparkExecutor`; remote capabilities default to `false` and return `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`.
- Read-only MCP tools with explicit input/output schemas: `get_project`, `get_task`, and `get_status`.
- Independent result verification for schema, task/execution identity, expected output shape, and terminal-state consistency.
- Structured audit interface, in-memory sink, required Phase 1 events, and recursive secret redaction.
- Deterministic tests that do not use Genspark credentials.

## Proven vs. unverified capabilities

| Capability | Phase 1 status |
|---|---|
| Canonical task validation and lifecycle enforcement | Proven by local tests |
| Independent policy allow/deny behavior | Proven by local tests |
| Deterministic mock execution | Proven by local tests |
| Verification can reject false completion | Proven by local tests |
| MCP server exposes only three read tools with schemas | Proven by code/tests |
| Audit events and sensitive-value redaction | Proven by local tests |
| Cloudflare Worker health/MCP serving | Locally/build verifiable; production URL must be checked after deploy |
| Genspark Connectors and custom/community MCP support | Confirmed by official documentation |
| Genspark invoking this deployed MCP server | Requires an external connection proof; not claimed by unit tests |
| External application submitting Genspark tasks | Unverified/disabled |
| Remote Genspark Code execution | Unverified/disabled |
| Genspark status/result/cancel/retry API | Unverified/disabled |
| Production task execution through the bridge | Not part of Phase 1 acceptance |

A Genspark web UI URL is not treated as an API. No private endpoint, token format, or protocol is fabricated.

## Safe MCP resources

| Tool | Known identifier | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `get_project` | `proof-project` | Returns the harmless fixed proof project |
| `get_task` | `proof-task` | Returns a public-safe task summary; task input is not disclosed |
| `get_status` | `proof-execution` | Returns deterministic terminal status |

Unknown resources return `UNKNOWN_RESOURCE`; malformed inputs return `INVALID_INPUT`. There are no Phase 1 write tools.

## HTTP entry points

| Method/path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Service and Phase 1 capability status |
| `POST /mcp` | MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint |
| `GET /mcp` | MCP transport request handling where supported by the SDK |
| `GET /audit` | Runtime-local, already-redacted audit evidence |

The in-memory audit sink is intentionally replaceable through the `AuditSink` interface and is not durable across Worker restarts.

## Install, test, and build

Requirements: Node.js 20+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Expected acceptance checks:

- TypeScript typecheck exits successfully.
- All deterministic tests pass without external credentials.
- `dist/_worker.js` is produced for Cloudflare Pages advanced mode.

## Run the MCP server locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Wrangler listens on port `3000`. Check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/audit
```

Use an MCP client against `http://localhost:3000/mcp`. See `docs/11_MCP_PROOF_RUNBOOK.md` for the external Genspark connection proof. A visible model response alone is not server-side proof; inspect redacted audit evidence as well.

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages with BYOK

Use a Cloudflare API token supplied through secret/environment injection; never place it in the repository.

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npx wrangler pages project create <project-name> \
  --production-branch main \
  --compatibility-date 2026-09-22
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name <project-name>
```

For a redeploy, skip project creation. Verify after deployment:

```bash
curl https://<project-name>.pages.dev/health
curl https://<project-name>.pages.dev/audit
```

Deployment publishes the bridge service and safe MCP tools; it does **not** enable production task execution or any unverified Genspark capability.

## Data architecture

- Canonical tasks, executor results, policy decisions, and verification outcomes are strongly typed TypeScript objects.
- `MockExecutor` state and audit events are runtime-local in-memory data for deterministic Phase 1 behavior.
- No persistent database, KV namespace, R2 bucket, or real credential store is used in Phase 1.
- A durable audit backend can later implement `AuditSink` without changing domain logic.

## Security boundaries

- Default allow: low/medium-risk read operations and mock execution with proven capabilities.
- Default deny: arbitrary external writes, production deployment, high/critical risk, secrets in task input, unknown executor capabilities, and Genspark private/web endpoints.
- `.env.example` contains empty placeholders only; real `.env*` files are ignored.
- API keys, bearer tokens, passwords, cookies, authorization headers, secret-like fields, and credential-bearing URLs are redacted from audit output.

## Not yet implemented

- Official external-to-Genspark submission, status, result, cancel, retry, or Code-mode integration.
- Production mutations, deployments initiated as tasks, or write-capable MCP tools.
- Durable task/execution/audit persistence.
- Authentication, multi-tenancy, operator UI, and approval workflows.
- A completed live Genspark-to-MCP connection proof for a deployed URL.

## Recommended next steps

1. Deploy and execute the read-only MCP proof from Genspark Connectors.
2. Capture server-side audit evidence without credentials.
3. Update the capability matrix only from official/public evidence.
4. Add durable storage and authentication before exposing user-specific task data.
5. Add write tools only after explicit authorization, idempotency, and production approval controls exist.
